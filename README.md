# LoL AI Draft Picker

A machine learning-based draft pick assistant for **League of Legends**, trained to suggest optimal champion picks and roles based on professional play data.

---

## üöÄ Features

- Predicts **optimal champions** and **roles** using AI
- Trained on **historical LCK draft data**
- Modular architecture: scraping, preprocessing, training
- Easily extendable for new patches or metas

---

## üì¶ How to Use

1. Clone the Repository
	```bash
	git clone https://github.com/AsperaDesu/LoL-AI-Draft-Picker.git
	cd LoL-AI-Draft-Picker
	```

2. Run [data_scraper.py](https://github.com/AsperaDesu/LoL-AI-Draft-Picker/blob/main/code/data_scraper.py)
   You may modify the URL variable to have a dataset of a different tournament.

	```python
	import json
	from tqdm import tqdm

	URL = "https://lol.fandom.com/wiki/Special:RunQuery/PickBanHistory?PBH%5Bpage%5D=LCK+2024+Summer&PBH%5Btextonly%5D=Yes&_run="
	HEADERS = {"User-Agent": "Mozilla/5.0"}

	```
3. Output

   A new `.json` file will be created in the `data/` folder. It contains scraped pick and ban data.

4. Train the Model

	Run every cell in [training.ipynb](https://github.com/AsperaDesu/LoL-AI-Draft-Picker/blob/main/code/training.ipynb "training.ipynb") to start training the model.

---
## ‚ö° Optional: Skip Training

If you don't want to retrain the model from scratch, you can use the pre-trained weights provided:

1. In  [training.ipynb](https://github.com/AsperaDesu/LoL-AI-Draft-Picker/blob/main/code/training.ipynb "training.ipynb"), skip the training cell and run the very bottom cell:

	```python
	model.load_state_dict(torch.load('model_weights.pth'))
	model.eval()
	```
This skips the training process and lets you instantly run inference.

## Overview
This is a project created to test my knowledge from [Andrej Karpathy's NN Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ "Andrej Karpathy's NN Playlist"). Noticably, the implementation of Self Attention and Transformer in this project is majorly inspired from what he had covered. 
##### Core Components & Techniques
- **Input Masking**
	Inspired from how Transformers are masked where inputs are only known until the `N`-th element.
	
- **Winner Emb**
	The usage of `winner_emb` is to encourage the model to optimize towards the winning draft and less to the losing one.
	
- **Class Emb**
	To make the model understand the composition of the team. 
	- Contains special token `START`
	
- **Position Emb**
	To distinguish first pick, last pick and anything in between
	
- **Type Emb**
	Differentiates Pick and Ban
	- Contains special token `START`

- **Score Linear Projection**
	To estimate a score to measure how "optimal" a champion is on that current patch and pass it down to a projection layer.
	
- **Team Emb**
	Blue versus Red Team's turn is different so we factor that in to the input
	- Contains special token `START`
	
- **Champ Emb**
	Every champ has different skillset, counter, and countered by.
	- Contains special token `<start>`

- **Joint Logits**
	Stores logits with the last two shape of (champ_vocab, ROLES) so the model's output contains how synergeous a champion is to all possible roles.

- **Champ and Role Loss**
	While not used/returned during forward function, it is used to help guide the model effectively.
	
- **Top K Sampling during Simulation**
	Due to concerns that the set of champions that are appropriate to pick/ban combined don't have a high enough probability to make it consistent, we only sample the 20 highest logits.

## Loss Graph
```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    lossi = torch.tensor(lossi)
    loss_50 = lossi.view(-1, 50)
    loss_50_mean = loss_50.mean(dim=1)
	
    plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
    plt.plot(loss_50_mean)
```

## What to be Improved
- [ ] Add full flex-pick role probability modeling
- [ ] Model can reevaluate roles after a flex pick
- [ ] Deploy as a public web app or Discord bot
- [ ] Closer attention to Trio ([Top, Mid, Jungle], [Bot, Support, Jungle]) and Duo (Bot and Support) synergies
